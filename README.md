# liri-bot

### LIRI is like SIRI, but it only knows a few commands:
* "concert-this artist" searches Bands In Town for upcoming concerts. Replace artist with your favorite artist.
* "spotify-this-song title" searches Spotify for song information. Replace title with your favorite song.
* "movie-this title" search OMDB for movie information. Replace title with your favorite movie.
* "do-what-it-says" runs a pre determined command from a text file. Don't add a suffix.
